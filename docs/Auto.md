# Auto Format Code
{: .no_toc }


PyCharm automatically checks for PEP 8 violations but it is not quite the same as PEP 8 in the pycthon official website, which help your code clearer and easier to read. However, you have to manually correct each problem, PyCharm only do checks, not corrections. 

Luckily, this file will teach you how to let PyCharm auto formatting your code in PEP8.

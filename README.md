# How to use PyCharm - A User Documentation Making-of

"How to use PyCharm" helps users with little experience to begin programming on JetBrains' Python integrated development environment (IDE).

## About us

"How to use PyCharm" was created by a team of three, Dani Jin, James Liu, and Vincent Wang. We believe in making products that are easy to access, use and understand. To achieve this, we produced straightforward explanations and stringent style guidelines. As a result, the documentation package has high readability.

## The structure

This user documentation was built upon [just-the-docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs), a Jekyll extension. This tool creates the framework of the document, allowing us to focus more on content creation.

## The documentation guideline

This user documentation followed [Google's developer documentation guideline](https://developers.google.com/style). Therefore, users would find this documentation easy to follow as most of them are accustomed to this style.

## The Markdown language

This user documentation was written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) markup. Being a light-weighted markup language, Markdown's source code can be easily read and edit by non-technical users. Additionally, it also has the functionality to display as static web pages.

## The challenges and obstacles

We faced many challenges and obstacles during the production of this documentation. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the project was completed without any face-to-face entirely. Additionally, our team members were in different time zones. Therefore it was harder for us to communicate. Moreover, we are all new to the Markdown language and the Jekyll theme, so we also took some time getting familiar with them.

Thank you very much for reading our work! Any questions or feedbacks are highly appreciated, and we will get back to you ASAP.

# Debug your Python source code
{: .no_toc }
In this procedure, you will debug your first python application. To eliminate any potential bugs, programmers usually use debugging tools to find bugs in their project. By the end of this procedure, you will be able to debug your Python project.

## Pre-requisites
Before debugging, make sure you have met the following requirements.
* You have installed the Python interpreter
* You have opened an existing project or created a new project.

## Instructions
1. The following is a piece of code for demonstration, and you want to use it to calculate the sum from one to five. However, there is a bug in it, so you get an output of 10 instead of 15.

    ![Sample Code](../../assets/images/docs/debug/foo.png "Sample Code")

2. To find out what is going wrong, you have to set a breakpoint. To create breakpoints, just click the line number.
